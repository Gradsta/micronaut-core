To allow any origin for a given configuration, don't include the `allowedOrigins` key in your configuration.

For multiple valid origins, set the `allowedOrigins` key of the configuration to a list of strings. Each value can either be a static value (`http://www.foo.com`) or a regular expression (`^http(|s)://www\.google\.com$`). However, a regular expression is allowed only if the `allowedOriginaRegex` configuration value is `true`: it defaults to `false`.

Regular expressions are passed to link:{javase}java/util/regex/Pattern.html#compile-java.lang.String-[Pattern#compile] and compared to the request origin with link:{javase}java/util/regex/Matcher.html#matches--[Matcher#matches].

.Example CORS Configuration

micronaut:
  server:
    cors:
      enabled: true
      configurations:
        web:
          allowedOriginsRegex: true

            - ^http(|s):\/\/www\.google\.com$

WARNING: The `allowedOriginaRegex` configuration should be used judiciously. In this example, it will match http://foo.com and http://fooxcom. That's not an issue when there's no subdomain, but if there is, it allows an attacker to hijack the domain: When http://www.foo.com is configured for cors, an attacker may register wwwxfoo.com, and get full cors access. This means it's easy – with `allowedOriginaRegex` set to `true` – to accidentally make an insecure configuration, and is why the default is `false`.
