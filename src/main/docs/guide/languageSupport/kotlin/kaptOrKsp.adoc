Micronaut Framework has offered support for Kotlin via https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/kapt.html[Kapt].

With version 4.0, Micronaut Framework supports Kotlin also via https://kotlinlang.org/docs/ksp-overview.html[Kotlin Symbol Processing (KSP) API].

Please note that `kapt` is in maintenance mode. Micronaut Kotlin users should move to our KSP support.
